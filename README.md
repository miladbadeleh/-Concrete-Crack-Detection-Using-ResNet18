## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use the ResNet18 architecture for image classification tasks. The model is trained on a custom dataset, validated during training, and finally evaluated on a test set. The trained model is saved to Google Drive for future use. The code is written in PyTorch and includes features like data augmentation, GPU support, and progress bars for training and evaluation.

## Architecture

### ResNet18
ResNet18 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is 18 layers deep. It was introduced in the paper [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) by He et al. The key innovation of ResNet is the use of **residual blocks**, which allow the network to learn identity mappings, making it easier to train very deep networks.

#### Key Features of ResNet18:
- **Residual Blocks**: Each residual block contains two convolutional layers with skip connections that bypass these layers. This helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.
- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of fully connected layers at the end, ResNet uses global average pooling to reduce the spatial dimensions to 1x1.
- **Pretrained Weights**: The model can be initialized with pretrained weights from ImageNet, which helps in transfer learning tasks.

## Code Explanation

### 1. **Setup and Imports**
The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as `torch`, `torchvision`, and `tqdm`. It also checks if a GPU is available and mounts Google Drive for dataset access.

```python
import os
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torchvision import datasets, transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from tqdm import tqdm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Check if GPU is available
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
print(f"Using device: {device}")

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
### 2. Data Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed using transforms.Compose, which includes resizing, converting images to tensors, and normalizing them using ImageNet mean and standard deviation.
```transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),  # Resize images to 224x224
    transforms.ToTensor(),           # Convert images to PyTorch tensors
    transforms.Normalize(            # Normalize with ImageNet mean and std
        mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
        std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    )
])
```
### 3. Loading Datasets
The datasets are loaded using torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder, which assumes the data is organized in folders by class. Data loaders are created for training, validation, and testing.

```train_dataset = datasets.ImageFolder(root="/content/drive/MyDrive/train", transform=transform)
val_dataset = datasets.ImageFolder(root="/content/drive/MyDrive/validation", transform=transform)
test_dataset = datasets.ImageFolder(root="/content/drive/MyDrive/test", transform=transform)

train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=8, shuffle=True)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=8, shuffle=False)
test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=8, shuffle=False)
```
### 4. Model Definition
The ResNet18 model is loaded with pretrained weights, and the final fully connected layer is modified to match the number of classes in the dataset.

```model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
num_classes = len(train_dataset.classes)
model.fc = nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, num_classes)
model = model.to(device)
```
### 5. Training and Validation
The training loop includes forward and backward passes, loss calculation, and optimization. A progress bar is added using tqdm to monitor training and validation.
```
def train(model, train_loader, val_loader, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs=10):
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        model.train()
        running_loss = 0.0
        correct = 0
        total = 0
        
        train_loop = tqdm(train_loader, desc=f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}] Training")
        for images, labels in train_loop:
            images, labels = images.to(device), labels.to(device)
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(images)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            running_loss += loss.item()
            _, predicted = outputs.max(1)
            total += labels.size(0)
            correct += predicted.eq(labels).sum().item()
            train_loop.set_postfix(loss=loss.item(), accuracy=(100. * correct / total))
        
        train_loss = running_loss / len(train_loader)
        train_acc = 100. * correct / total
        print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Train Loss: {train_loss:.4f}, Train Acc: {train_acc:.2f}%")
        
        # Validation loop
        model.eval()
        val_loss = 0.0
        correct = 0
        total = 0
        
        val_loop = tqdm(val_loader, desc=f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}] Validation")
        with torch.no_grad():
            for images, labels in val_loop:
                images, labels = images.to(device), labels.to(device)
                outputs = model(images)
                loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
                val_loss += loss.item()
                _, predicted = outputs.max(1)
                total += labels.size(0)
                correct += predicted.eq(labels).sum().item()
                val_loop.set_postfix(loss=loss.item(), accuracy=(100. * correct / total))
        
        val_loss = val_loss / len(val_loader)
        val_acc = 100. * correct / total
        print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Val Loss: {val_loss:.4f}, Val Acc: {val_acc:.2f}%")
    
    print("Training complete.")
```
### 6. Testing and Saving the Model
After training, the model is evaluated on the test set, and the trained model is saved to Google Drive.
```
def test(model, test_loader, criterion):
    model.eval()
    test_loss = 0.0
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    
    test_loop = tqdm(test_loader, desc="Testing")
    with torch.no_grad():
        for images, labels in test_loop:
            images, labels = images.to(device), labels.to(device)
            outputs = model(images)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            test_loss += loss.item()
            _, predicted = outputs.max(1)
            total += labels.size(0)
            correct += predicted.eq(labels).sum().item()
            test_loop.set_postfix(loss=loss.item(), accuracy=(100. * correct / total))
    
    test_loss = test_loss / len(test_loader)
    test_acc = 100. * correct / total
    print(f"Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}, Test Acc: {test_acc:.2f}%")
